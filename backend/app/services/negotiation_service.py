"""Negotiation copilot: turn flagged clauses into a ready-to-send message.

Takes the clauses the user wants to renegotiate (plus how they want to come
across) and drafts a plain-language message they can copy and send to the other
party. Runs on a dedicated Groq key via ``negotiation_complete`` so drafting has
its own rate limit, separate from the main analysis pipeline.
